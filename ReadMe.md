## What I have learnt while making this project?

> Thanks to the previous projects, this project was not much challenging other than making it fully-responsive on devices of all sizes, but it helped me get better with using HTML & CSS to create stunning Landing pages without the use of any external libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

#

## Time taken to complete this project:
> Around 4 hrs spent in developing this Landing Page.
